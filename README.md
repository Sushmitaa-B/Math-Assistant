# 🧮 Mathematical Assistant (Java Swing)

This project is a **Java Swing desktop application** that performs arithmetic operations and visualizes the **Fibonacci curve**.

It replicates the design and behavior of the Python Streamlit app [Math01](https://math01-gcujq4iq4nfavwz3tg9bur.streamlit.app/).
